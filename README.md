Welcome to my 100 Days of Code with Python repository! ðŸš€

## About

This repository documents my journey through the "100 Days of Code with Python" challenge by the course created by Angela Yu on Udemy. The challenge involves coding for at least an hour every day for 100 days, focusing on Python programming.

## Motivation

I've embarked on this challenge to enhance my Python programming skills, deepen my understanding of core concepts, and build practical projects along the way. Through consistent daily practice, I aim to become a more proficient coder and strengthen my problem-solving abilities.

## Course Overview

The "100 Days of Code with Python" course by Angela Yu covers a wide range of topics, including:

- Python fundamentals
- Data structures and algorithms
- Web development with Flask
- Data analysis and visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib
- GUI (Graphical User Interface) development with Tkinter
- Working with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
- Building games and interactive projects

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each day of the challenge. Inside each folder, you'll find Python files for the mini-projects, exercises, or challenges completed on that day. Additionally, there's a README.md file in each folder providing details about the tasks accomplished and any insights gained.

Feel free to explore the code and follow along with my progress! Any feedback or suggestions are highly appreciated.
